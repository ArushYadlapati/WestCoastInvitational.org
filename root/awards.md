There will be awards (trophy) for the following categories:
- **Winning Alliance Captain**: The captain of the winning alliance.
- **Winning Alliance Partner**: The partner of the winning alliance.
- **Finalist Alliance Captain**: The captain of the finalist alliance.
- **Finalist Alliance Partner**: The partner of the finalist alliance.
- **Advisory's Award (NEW)**: The WCI Advisory Board will select a team that they feel is deserving of this award. This award is not based on the robot, but rather the team as a whole.


Awards will be similarly designed to last year (wave logo, but be cut out of polycarbonate). All awards will be the same size.
